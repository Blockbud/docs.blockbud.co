### Prerequistes

- A Map/Model under ã€œ10MB file size
- Mineways `for maps`
- Blender or Cinema4D or Blockbud Workshop `for those who don't have *.GLB extension Model`

What our model looks like:

For interested people [there is a full Mineways documentation about issues & options](http://www.realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/mineways.html)

### Common issues

- If your model have lines between blocks:<br/>
  â†“ While exporting Model from Mineways, be sure "Export individual textures to `tex`" is selected

### Scripting

**From now, we will use Blender's scripting abilities to make our task easier.**

We are still working on some workshop abilities to make your job easier, some tasks are still in development & looks hopeful. We will announce when the magicðŸ§™ comes out. In first term, we are researching if there is a way to solve this problems in our engine directly, if not: we are developing a workshop task to achieve & publish to our users. We call it magikðŸª„

- Textures are blurry<br/>
  â†“ If you are using Blender as exporter, setting texture sampling option in material to be "Closest" solves the issue. However Mineways have a script for that to be easy for not changing all block materials one-by-one manually.

```py
import bpy

for mat in bpy.data.materials:
    if not mat.node_tree:
        continue
    for node in mat.node_tree.nodes:
        if node.type == 'TEX_IMAGE':
            node.interpolation = 'Closest'
```

// Image

- For best Glass Texture, set Blend & Shadow mode to Alpha Hashed

```py
import bpy

for mat in bpy.data.materials:
    """If material has nodetree"""
    if mat.node_tree:
        for node in mat.node_tree.nodes:
            if node.type == 'BSDF_PRINCIPLED':
                alphasocket = node.inputs["Alpha"]
                if alphasocket.is_linked:
                    mat.blend_method = 'HASHED'
                    mat.shadow_method = 'HASHED'
```
