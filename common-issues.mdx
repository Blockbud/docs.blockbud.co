Let's make sure you checked this document before sending a message on anywhere about an issue.

### Blender
- If your textures looks blurry:<br/>
  ↓ In Blender, make sure every block interpolation is set to "Closest": no worry, you don't have to make every texture one by one. There is a Blender script for this:
  <Frame><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VAs60XC.png" alt="Texture Interpolation @ Blender" /></Frame>

```py Blurry Script
import bpy

for mat in bpy.data.materials:
    if not mat.node_tree:
        continue
    for node in mat.node_tree.nodes:
        if node.type == 'TEX_IMAGE':
            node.interpolation = 'Closest'
```
Before -> Blurry
