Blender is easiest way to convert your model into GLB: `[filename].GLB`.


To import your model:
- File -> Import -> `Your model type` -> `Choose file`<br/>
  ↓ We imported the model:
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ikPA02s.jpeg" alt="Model" />
  <Warning>
    Make sure you deleted all objects except your model. You can add light, fog & other effects with Blockbud.
  </Warning>



To export your model:
- File -> Export glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf)<br/>
  ↓ Make sure you selected "Format: glTF Binary (.glb)" as below

That's it!
