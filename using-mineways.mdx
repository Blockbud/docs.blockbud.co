Mineways is a program that allows users to convert their map into several file type. You can use `[filename].SCHEMATIC`, `level.dat` files & `world` folder to convert.


Alright, we know. Mineways is a not that complicated tool but anyway, we need to make this tutorial.


- To open your world: File -> Open World -> `Choose file`<br/>
  ↓ After you choose your world file, Mineways will show a top-down view of what you're map is.

- Right click to select where you want to export, remember: how much block you selecting, less performance you get
- To export: File -> Export for Rendering

<Warning>
    Mineways is not too complicated but options are. Don't touch anything while exporting unless you know.
</Warning>

- After "Model Export Dialog" opens: make sure to check "Export individual textures to `tex`"<br/>
  ↓ Also you might wanna choose a folder since Mineways is exporting more than one file.

That's it!
